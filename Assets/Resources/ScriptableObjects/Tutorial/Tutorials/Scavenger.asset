    description: "The M101 Barrett or Scavenger  is a support drone designed to accompany
      the M1A4 Juggernaut and its successor\u2014the XM2 Reginleif. It is equipped
      with two high-operation crane arms and one large container mount, and has a
      loading capacity of over 10 tons.\n\nPress [F] to order the Scavenger to follow
      you. \nPress [H] to order it to stop.\nPress [G] to choose its destination.
      Confirm with [Left Click] or cancel with [G] again.\n\nWhile nearby, press
      [R] to order it to reload your Juggernaut. This process can take a while and
      you may be exposed to the enemy so assure your safety.\n\nThe Scavenger does
      not have unlimited ammo but enough to hold against an army of Legions. However,
      for the same reason, it holds explosive munition and if destroyed, may provoke
      a brutal explosion.\n\nProtect this unit at all cost as without them, you are
      just doomed. "
